Techniques in electricity resource planning including methodologies for reliability evaluation and assessment, production costing, marginal costing, supply-side and demand-side planning, integrated planning, and planning under competition. Prerequisite: MATH 415, ECE 313, and ECE 476.
"
ECE 590,Grad Sem in Special Topics,0 to 2,"
Lectures and discussions on current research and literature on advanced topics in electrical engineering. Approved for S/U grading only. May be repeated. Prerequisite: Consent of instructor.
"
ECE 594,Math Models of Language,3 or 4,"
Mathematical models of linguistic structure and their implementation in computational algorithms used in automatic speech understanding and speech synthesis. Statistical and automata-theoretic techniques are studied allowing a quantitative description of acoustic-phonetics, phonology, phonotactics, lexicons, syntax, and semantics. The methods are used to build components of a speech understanding system. For 4 hours credit, an extended project is required. Prerequisite: ECE 537.
"
